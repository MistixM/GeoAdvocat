## About

**GeoAdvocat** is a Telegram-controlled automation assistant that monitors [Threads](https://threads.com) for conversations relevant to your niche, then engages with them using intelligent, AI-generated comments.

You define the topics. The bot finds the right posts. AI writes the replies. You grow your audience while you sleep.

<br/>

## How It Works

```
You configure topics & keywords
        ↓
Bot searches Threads for matching posts
        ↓
AI analyzes each post for relevance
        ↓
AI generates a natural, on-brand comment
        ↓
Comment is posted automatically
        ↓
Repeat — on a smart schedule with built-in delays
```

Everything is managed through a simple **Telegram chat**. Send a command — the bot does the rest.

<br/>
